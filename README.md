# Using Web Images & Natural Language for Object Localization in a Robotics Environment

This repo is a collection of code used for the multiple experiments in my Master's thesis: Using Web Images & Natural Language for Object Localization in a Robotics Environment.

This repo was used in conjunction with my [webly dataset creator](https://github.com/Jrokisky/webly-dataset-creator) and [ARID dataset helper](https://github.com/Jrokisky/Arid-Dataset-Helper).

The code for training the webly supervised binary classifier can be found in [train_binary_classifier.py](train_binary_classifier.py).

The [notebooks](notebooks) directory contains multiple jupyter notebooks for plotting various graphs and visualizing results.

Various graphs and plots of the results displayed in the thesis can be seen in [images](images). One graph specifically of interest is the comparison of the approach introduced in this work against Faster R-CNN, which can be seen [here](https://github.com/Jrokisky/thesis/blob/main/images/approach_comparison.png).
