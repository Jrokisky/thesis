# thesis
This repo is a collection of code used for the multiple experiments in my Master's thesis: Using Web Images & Natural Language for Object Localization in a Robotics Environment.

This repo was used in conjunction with my [webly dataset creator](https://github.com/Jrokisky/webly-dataset-creator) and [ARID dataset helper](https://github.com/Jrokisky/Arid-Dataset-Helper).
